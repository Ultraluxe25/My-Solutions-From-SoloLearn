<svg width="1000" height="250">
    <rect width="150" height="150" fill="orange">
        <animate attributeName="x" from="0" to="300"
      dur="3s" fill="freeze" repeatCount="indefinite"/> 
    </rect>
</svg>

<!--
attributeName: Specifies which attribute will be affected by the animation
from: Specifies the starting value of the attribute
to: Specifies the ending value of the attribute
dur: Specifies how long the animation runs (duration)
fill: Specifies whether or not the attribute's value should return to its initial value
 when the animation is finished (Values: "remove" resets the value; "freeze" keeps the “to value”)
repeatCount: Specifies the repeat count of the animation

In the example above, the rectangle changes its x attribute from 0 to 300 in 3 seconds.
To repeat the animation indefinitely, use the value "indefinite" for the repeatCount attribute.
